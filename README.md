# Smart Irrigation and Monitoring System

Agriculture is the art of science or exercise of farming, which play a vital role in the ecosystem. The survival and existence of the world is in the hands of the agriculture. It includes the cultivation of the soil for the growing of crops, vegetables and fruits.
So, we proposed one system that solve the problem of water and save farmers time which he spend for the water supplying to the crops.
We are making a system that supply water to the crops based on the moisture level of the soil. Different crops and soil need different amount of water. So, we set that threshold value in the device that is work based on values.
